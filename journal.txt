List of changes done to get it to compile -

removed dependencies to old resource.h header file as it was creating a chicken / egg problem
included enemy.h in game.h
game.h in main.cpp

The above makes sense as the engine is game.cpp


Issues detected -

//FIXED
enemy.cpp line 45 46 adding additional enemy on second loop - Solved by changing tracker to check against half noOfEnemies instead of 5 for fixed 10 enemies 


ACTION PLAN 

1. Create ID for each message / packet that will be sent, increment ID on each send
2. Implement non blocking using selectors
3. Game Time should be frame independent, I will send this to the client at the start of sending so after selecting the an option
4. Send position updates to the client and array of boolean of true / false for enemy spaceships
5. Bullet fired, simulate player position on firing
6. Disregard packets which have a smaller ID given we are using UDP

Networking Protocol

What values are you exchanging, when, how - value of data frequency; why are you doing it this way; what's in the packet

API - SFML

for every chapter, what how why

integration, how you connect main networking code with the game code... talk about why its not a separate class, unless you want it to be a
separate class

TO DO 

Re install Virtual Box will probably solve the issue of bridged networking.
